# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the project dependencies, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

or

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view your application by opening your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
