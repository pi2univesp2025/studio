/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Bazaar Showcase.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has exclusive
 * access to their own data, which is nested under their unique user ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}/products/{productId}`: Stores product information, accessible only
 *   by the user identified by `userId`.
 * - `/users/{userId}/theme`: Stores theme settings, accessible only by the user
 *   identified by `userId`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data. No cross-user data access is allowed.
 * - Listing all users or products across all users is explicitly denied.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The data structure itself embeds the authorization: the user ID is part of the path.
 *
